// .hpp files contain class declarations. That is, they declare what methods and
// variables are contained in a class, but they do not implement the methods. This
// is the job of the .cpp file. Below, the class SequentialList contains a bunch of
// methods and 3 member variables. This is how it can be used by other programmers.
//
// SequentialList.hpp
// SequentialList implements list using a sequential block of memory.
// When created, it dynamically allocates an array to store the list data.
// Once allocated, the list cannot be resized.

// NOTES ON CONST KEYWORD
// The const keyword, when used after a class member function, means that
// that function does not change any data members of the object (i.e., the
// object remains the same after the function is called; the function only
// tells you something about the class).

// NOTES ON COPY CONSTRUCTORS, ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS, AND DESTRUCTORS
// Whenever a class dynamically allocates memory, three functions generally 
// have to be implemented: the copy constructor, the assignment operator,
// and the destructor. This is known as the Rule of Three. The destructor,
// as you already know, is responsible for freeing the dynamically allocated
// memory, thereby preventing memory leaks. The copy constructor is responsible
// for making a copy of your class. The assignment (=) operator is also
// responsible for making a copy of your class, but using the = syntax instead
// of a constructor. The reason that you should never implement only a
// destructor is that C++ automatically implements a basic copy constructor
// and assignment operator, and for dynamically allocated memory, the
// automatic copy constructor and assignment operator usually don't work.
// For example, when you have a pointer in your class, the automatic copy
// constructor will simply copy the pointer, and leave it pointing to the
// data of the original object. If the original object is then deleted, its
// destructor will delete all the data, leaving the copied object with a
// pointer to freed memory. This is always bad. What we've done below is
// to make the copy constructor and assignment operator private and then leave them
// un-implemented. This prevents C++ from automatically making an assignment
// operator and copy constructor, and since they are private, they can never
// be called outside the class, so it's okay that we don't implement them.
